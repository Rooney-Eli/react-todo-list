This is a todo-list written in react-native.


The application only has a single page. In that page a user is able to enter text into a field, and have it listed for later use.

To Add an item, type into the text box at the top of the list, and then press the + button on the right side of that text box.

To Join two different todos, long press anywhere on the listed items section and then click the checkboxes of the items you wish to join together. Once the desired items are selected, click the green Join button that is directly on the left of the checkbox.

To Split a previously joined item into separate items, click the green split button on the right side of the item.

to Delete an item, click the red X on the right of the item.


Known issues:
    -When a previously joined item is split, the list will generate an empty todo item along with the newly generated items and display it.
